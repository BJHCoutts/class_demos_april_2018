// URL http://localhost:454545/hello_world?name=steve&message=hello+there
// scheme   | host     | port| path       | query string

// The "scheme" identifies the protocol being used.
// Typically, HTTP or HTTPS, but could SSH, FTP, TCP, etc.

// The "host" identify the domain or IP that holds the server.

// The "path" identifes the specific resource we want to make
// request to on the server.

// The "query string" is way to store data in a URL.
// It uses the "url encoding" format.
// A query sting always begins with "?".
// It is then followed by key-values pairs.
// A key value pair defined as such {key}={value}
// Pairs are seperated by "&".

// This tells our app to respond to a GET request only
// if the path is "/hello_world". When request is made to
// that location by a client (i.e. browser), the callback
// at argument 2 is called.

// Inside the callback, we write code that builds the response.

  // the request being made by a client to the server. It
  // contains all the information needed to respond back.

  // the server's reply to the client. We use it to end a response
  // and send back data to the client.
